In this code, we create a RFIDReader class which inherits from the BoxLayout class in Kivy. The RFIDReader class initializes an instance of the SimpleMFRC522 class and creates a label widget to display the scanned RFID card's information.

The read_card method is called when the user scans an RFID card. It calls the read method of the SimpleMFRC522 class to read the card's ID and text. Then, it updates the label widget's text with the card's ID and text.

Finally, we create an instance of the MyApp class and call its run method to start the Kivy application. The build method of the MyApp class returns an instance of the RFIDReader class. The GPIO.cleanup() method is called to clean up any GPIO pins that were used by the SimpleMFRC522 class.
